This program is meant for searching attractions in the Charlotte Metro area that are worth your time 
It searches through 50 attractions in the Charlotte area and based on what you enter in your input based on the options given it will give you the attractions that fulfill your defined attributes

Some quick things to know about the searcher:

1. The searcher will only work if the input you enter is one of the options listed when you enter the input or else it will not work
2. If there are no attractions that match the criteria you enter than a message will appear saying "No attractions found based on your criteria"
3. When you specify in your imputs that you want your attraction to be extended it will be open during the day as well.
